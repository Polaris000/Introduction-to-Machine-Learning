# Introduction-to-Machine-Learning

This is my first dive into the vast field of machine learning. This repo will have simple machine learning algorithms which deal with  
linear regression, kNN classifiers, matplotlib, pandas, quandl and sklearn.  

Initially, the existing datasets in sklearn like iris dataset will be used. I will start with supervised machine learning for now  
and build on that later on
